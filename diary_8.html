		<p>Over time, she seems to have become so calm. She told me she was on an island, what island...? I only know Amoy island. So I live on an island too! I think we're getting closer. I can't wait to see her. But maybe she's always been on an island far away? I remembered the beach photo she sent me ten years ago. I was on video chat with her recently and her body shape seems to be getting smaller, I guess that's because of the signal issue. She has a lot of friends here. But maybe she never knows that she is my only friend in the past years, but she seems so happy while I start to worry about her. I look forward to the day we meet.</p>
